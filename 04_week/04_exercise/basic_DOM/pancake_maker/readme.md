# Build a Pancake Maker with Dynamic Pricing

Objective: Implement JavaScript functionality for a pancake customization tool that dynamically updates the price based on user selections, such as pancake type, toppings, and extras. HTML and CSS are provided; your task is to add the JavaScript to make it interactive.

Your task is to write the JavaScript code that:

1. Listens for changes on the pancake type select box and all checkbox inputs.
2. Calculates the total price based on selections:
   - Pancake type has a base price.
   - Each topping adds $1 to the base price.
   - Extras have their specific prices.
3. Displays the dynamically updated total price in the #totalPrice span.

Use the `addEventListener` method for listening to changes and the suitable loop for iterating through checkbox inputs to calculate the total price. Remember to parse checkbox values as integers before adding them to the total.

# Optional Enhancements

- Integrate a font from Google Fonts to apply to all elements on the page. Select a font that aligns with the modern and appealing aesthetic of the project.
- Adjust the pancake image to cover 50% of the page and extend to full viewport height, creating a visually striking layout.
- Implement a captivating animation for the price display to draw attention to price changes.
- Ensure your application looks great on both desktop and mobile devices by employing responsive design techniques.
