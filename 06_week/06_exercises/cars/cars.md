# Cars

1. **Create a Car Class:**

   - Define a `Car` class with properties for the car's license plate, maker, model, current owner, price, and color.

2. **User Input for Car Details:**

   - Set up an HTML form for users to input the car's license plate, maker, model, current owner, price, and color.
   - Use JavaScript to collect the values entered by the user when the form is submitted.

3. **Create and Store Car Objects:**

   - Upon form submission, instantiate a new `Car` object using the collected input values.
   - Add this new `Car` object to an array that stores all the cars entered by the user.

4. **Display Car Information:**

   - Use JavaScript to dynamically generate a table on the webpage, displaying the information of each car in the array.
   - Ensure the table updates to include each new car when it is added.

5. **Search for a Car by License Plate:**

   - Implement a function that allows the user to search for a car using its license plate.
   - Include error handling to manage cases where the search input is invalid or the license plate cannot be found.

6. **Show Search Results:**

   - If the search successfully finds a car, display the car's make, model, and owner on the screen.
   - If no matching car is found, display a message indicating that no results were found.
