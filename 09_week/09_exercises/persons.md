In this task, you'll practice fetching data from an API, working with it, and displaying it on a webpage.
You'll use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to get user information and https://robohash.org/ to create robot avatars based on user IDs.

## What to Do:

1. Get User Data:

- Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to fetch a list of users.
- For each user, grab their name, username, email, and ID.

2. Show User Info:

- Make a card for each user with their name, username, and email displayed.

3. Add Robot Avatars:

- Use each user's ID to get a cat avatar from https://robohash.org/.
- For example, for a user with ID 1, the avatar URL would be: https://robohash.org/1.

4. Put Everything on the Page:

- Show the user info and cat avatars in a grid on the webpage.

5. Upload to a Server:

- Once the page is done, upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web server, so others can view your page live. You can use any web hosting service youâ€™re comfortable with (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other service).


## Acceptance Criteria:

- All users from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users should appear as cards on the webpage.
- Each user card should include their name, username, email, and cat avatar.
- The data should load and display when the page loads.
- The webpage must be hosted on a server so others can visit and view the project live.
- The layout should be responsive and visually clean.
