# Cars - Step 3

Store Car Data
- After adding a car to the list, ensure the car data is stored in LocalStorage. This will allow the car list to persist between page reloads.
  - Use localStorage.setItem() to store the cars array in LocalStorage as a JSON string.
- Update on Add/Delete: Ensure that whenever a car is added or deleted, LocalStorage is updated to reflect the current list of cars.
- Form Reset: After successfully adding a car, reset the form inputs and notify the user that the car has been added.
- When the page loads, retrieve any stored car data from LocalStorage.
  - Use localStorage.getItem() to retrieve the stored data and parse it back into an array using JSON.parse().
  - Repopulate the Car List: Once the car data is loaded from LocalStorage, repopulate the cars array in your application and update the display to show all the saved cars in the table.
  - Handle Empty LocalStorage: If no cars are stored in LocalStorage, ensure the application starts with an empty car list without errors.

- Delete Car Functionality: Add a delete button for each car in the list. When clicked, the button should:
  - Remove the car from both the cars array and LocalStorage.
  - Dynamically update the table to remove the deleted car.
  - Update LocalStorage: After deleting a car, ensure the updated cars array is saved in LocalStorage using localStorage.setItem().

- Enhanced Feedback: Provide clear feedback for the user when actions like adding or deleting a car occur.
  For example:
  - Display a success message when a car is successfully added.
  - Show a confirmation message when a car is deleted.

- Form Improvements: Refine the form design to improve user experience and ensure itâ€™s easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Table Display: Ensure the car table is responsive, clean, and displays the relevant car information clearly.

## Finalisation of the project

### Acceptance Criteria
